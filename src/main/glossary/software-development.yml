  Imports:
  - project-management.yml
  - virtual-file-system.yml
  Defines:
    Acceptance criteria: Conditions that, when met, unequivocally define success; usually expressed in terms of secondary artifacts
    Artifact: Something that is derived from source code and/or other artifacts
    Branch: Complete copy of all the source code
    Build: Series of generators where the output of one is used as input for the next
    Build description: Source code that defines what generators make up a build and how they are connected
    Class: Implementation type defined in source code
    Dependency: Artifact produced by another project
    Dependency description: Source code that defines what dependencies a dependency manager should pull into a project
    Dependency manager: Something that pulls required dependencies into a project
    Environment: The surroundings in which a build executes, including an VM or OS, a virtual file system storing a branch, and acceptance criteria
    Environment description: Source code that defines an environment
    Generator: Artifact that transforms source code and/or artifacts into new artifacts
    Merge: Combine changes in multiple branches
    Pipeline: Sequence of environments that artifacts are promoted through
    Pipeline description: Source code that describes a pipeline
    Primary artifact: Artifact of direct interest, like a compiled class file
    Promote: Move primary artifacts from one environment to the next when acceptance criteria are met
    Secondary artifact: Artifact that provides feedback about a transformation performed by a generator, like compiler errors
    Source code: A file produced by a project member, like a Java class or a user story
    Test: Source code that defines expected behavior of production source code
    Version: Contents of a source code file at a particular point in time, along with meta-data about the changes compared to the previous version, if any
